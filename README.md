# challenge 21 MERN

## Description

This is a website that should let you search and save books, but there is something wrong with saving to the api. 

## Installation

The deployed page can be found on [Render](https://challenge-21-mern.onrender.com). 

## Usage

This website will let you search books by name using the google API. As far as I can tell the framework is there to be able to login and save books, but I cannot figure out why it won't do it. 

## Credits

* edEx learning materials, source code Challenge 21 MERN
* Xpert Learning assistant, I often run my code through to check syntax or ask for update suggestions.
